            <p class= "S4"> Federal agent Kevin cabe, who had dealt with walter, approached him, called the Scorpio team and used their extensive knowledge of technology to solve severe crises. Because of the lack of social experiences, even team members can find comfort in each other, once they go out of this circle, their eccentric personality will bring them endless troubles. They rely on Peggy who worked at a restaurant to communicate with the outside world. Peggy has an intelligent son, Ralph, so she actually understands the inner world of geniuses. Without Peggy, these highly intelligent people can not be able to take care of themselves, and will be easily misunderstood. These clever nerds finally accepted the job opportunities provided by Cabe. It is a perfect job for them: they can be their own extraordinary wisdom to solve the national crisis. At the same time, they can help each other better integrate into modern society through this job. The problems they face range from minor problems with casino security to big problems with state-to-state relations, such as drone attacks.</p>
